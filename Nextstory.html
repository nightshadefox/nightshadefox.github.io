      The story of the gold Baby 

After Rumplestiltskin's visit the baby's hair turned to gold. They decided to call the baby Goldie. Goldie was sent to princess school along with all her friends she lived a very happy life. For her 10th birthday her parents bought her a pet horse so that she could learn to ride. 

Goldie didn’t like this gift because all she’d really wanted was Ze Stew. It was a special recipe invented by Mrs Bluh a long time ago. But no matter how hard the cooks tried they couldn’t find the secret ingredient. The queen was thinking about this for a very long time because all she wanted was for her little daughter to be happy. She thought back to the day Rumplestiltskin had visited. He’d wanted to take her first born child Goldie but the queen had managed to guess his name and out of anger Rumplestiltskin had torn himself in half. He was still buried in the queen's royal graveyard. 

But everyday the princess didn’t get her stew she grew more and more upset and began to break things. On her 11th birthday she asked for Ze Stew again and the cook gave her the same answer as always. “There is no stew.” 

The princess was so mad she picked up her butter knife and threw it at the cook. 
It flew straight through her chest and hit the wall behind. Goldie was so scared she ran outside and didn’t come back for days. 

The queen was very upset and sent everyone she could find to retrieve her daughter. The king was getting old and becoming more and more sick by the day. The only thing that kept him from giving up hope that he would recover was seeing his beautiful daughter every day. She would always come hug him and tell him about her day. Then she would tell him they were all going to be okay 

But ever since the princess had run away the king had been getting worse. This time the queen sent for a doctor to come and check if he was going to recover. After a few minutes of anxious waiting the doctor came out looking grim. 

“I’m afraid that the king's health is not good” he said. 

“Is there anything I can do” asked the queen sadly. 

“I think the princess being there was helping the king somehow” the doctor told the queen “there is no hope unless the princess is found. But she will only help his mood. I’m sorry but the king will die.” 

At these words the queen began to cry. She ran to her room and locked herself in not letting anyone come in. 

This was spread all over the village and people were search everywhere to find the princess. 

Meanwhile the princess was having an extremely hard time hiding. She’d taken to living in a tree. She’d sat in that tree for three days straight. Finally she couldn’t take the hunger any more. She climbed down from her tree while everyone was at lunch and began to look for something to eat. The princess eventually came across a small cottage. It wasn’t the size that appealed to her. It was the smell. She knew that smell. It was Ze Stew! 

The princess charged at the door and found it already open. She quickly headed towards the smell. She found herself entering a kitchen. On a table where three bowels of Ze Stew. The princess quickly went to the closest bowl and picked up the spoon. She shoveled some into her mouth before spitting it out. 

“Too hot” she said. 

She moved to the second bowl and picked up the spoon. She took another mouthful of Ze Stew. It tasted amazing but it was too cold for her liking. 

“Too cold” she decided. 

The princess moved to the final bowl of Ze Stew. She grabbed the spoon and piled a large amount onto her spoon. She shoveled it into her mouth. 

“Just right” she sighed. 

Within five minutes she had finished the entire bowl of stew. Goldie decided she needed to sit down. She walked into the living room and sat down on the biggest chair. It was very uncomfortable. 

“Too Hard” she said. 

She stood up and moved over to the next biggest chair. She sat down and tried to decide whether she liked the chair. 

“Too soft” she decided. 

She moved to the final chair. It was small and wooden but it looked a lot like her favorite chair from back at the castle. She moved over to it and sat down. 

“Just right” she sighed. 

She picked up a book from the floor and began to read. After a few minutes of learning about piggy, pickle, and ralph she had decided that the house was owned by people who had gone on holiday. 

Suddenly, she heard a cracking sound and the chair shattered into lots of small pieces. Goldie jumped up and looked at the broken chair barely fazed by it. 

Feeling full and happy that she’d found a new place to stay she headed upstairs to the bedroom. She turned right into what appeared to be a bedroom. 

She collapsed onto the closest bed but quickly sat up again. 

“Too hard” she said. 

She moved to the next bed which was covered in loads of fluffy pillows. She lay down and immediately sank so far into the bed she was almost hidden completely. 

“Too soft” she decided. 

She moved to the final bed which was smaller and red with a little quilt on top. She lay down and it wasn’t to hard and it wasn’t too soft. 

“Just right” she sighed. 

She turned away from the door and fell into a deep and comfortable sleep. 

Little did goldie know as soon as she fell asleep the three bears who owned the house arrived home. 

They noticed that the door had been open and got suspicious. They headed into the kitchen and checked their bowls of Ze Stew. It had been very hard to make and the’d had to steal a little boy to get it. 

“Someone’s eaten my stew!” said Daddy bear angrily. 

“Someone’s eaten my stew!” cried Mummy bear. 

“Someone’s eaten all of my stew!” Said baby bear sadly. He began to cry. Mummy bear went to comfort him while daddy bear went into the living room to sit down and think. 

“Someone’s sat in my chair too!” Daddy bear yelled. 

Mummy bear, carrying baby bear, hurried into the living room as well. 

“Someone’s sat in my chair!” she cried. 

“Someone’s sat in my chair and broke it!” Baby bear began to cry harder than before holding up one of the broken legs from his chair. Mummy bear picked him up and gave him a big hug. 

“Come on darling” she said “we’ll take you upstairs and put you to bed while Mummy makes you some more stew.” 

This didn’t cheer baby bear up but he followed him Mummy and Daddy upstairs. 

“Someone’s slept in my bed!” They heard Daddy bear yell from upstairs. 

“Someone’s slept in my bed too!” Mummy bear agreed. 

“Someone’s sleeping in my bed!” Baby bear cried. Mummy and Daddy bear quickly raced over so they were all standing around baby bear's bed. 

“Who are you?” Bellowed Daddy bear. 

“Goldie’s eyes shot open and she quickly sat up. 

“My name is Goldie” she said” i’m the princess and I just had some of the most wonderful stew from downstairs” 

“Because you ate the stew you can become the stew” said Daddy bear angrily.

The next day the three bears sent a parcel to the queen. 

It arrived later that day and was given directly to the queen. The queen had not been letting people into her room for the past couple of days but apparently the parcel had made her forget to lock the door again. 

The maid finally got into the queen's room the next day and a scream was heard from everywhere in the castle. The queen was hanging from the rafters a rope around her neck and a parcel open at the floor. The maid, shaking from head to foot, walked over and looked at the parcel. 

A bowl of the most delicious smelling stew was sitting beside a small badly written note. 

It read 

To her majesty the queen

We have found you daughter snooping around in our house yesterday evening and as you know the penalty for trespassing is death. We decided to be kinder to her as she is the princess and give her body back to the kingdom. Let this be a reminder that not even the princess can escape punishment for her actions. 

The three Bears

P.s she tasted delicious 

After the queen's death the king soon followed and the throne was passed down to the king's nephew, and he had a thing for women with small feet. 

The end
