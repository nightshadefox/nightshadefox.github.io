<h1> This is the story of rumplestiltskin </h1>

<h2> chapter 1 </h2> 
<h2> rumples story </h2> 

<p> This story begins  with a tree. When it became cold this tree started dying. The leaves were turning brown and red and just falling
off onto the grass below. The owner was getting worried and wondered who was killing his tree. He set up a tent right next to it and
stayed up all night to try to catch whoever was poisoning the tree. He managed to stay up the whole time up until when the sun started
to come up. When he woke up a few minutes later, more of the trees leaves were on the ground. </p> 

<p> He was so angry that he chopped down the tree, packed up his tent and left. Later that day, a little gremlin popped up out of the
tree stump with a vial of poison in his hand. He raged and threw the vial of poison as far as he could, then stomped off back into the
cave near by where he lived.</p> 

<p> Later in the week he went into town to trade something for some beans that he grew before he realized that he was allergic to them.
On his way in he saw a girl whe was with her father and the prince. They exchanged a few words before the girl walked off with the king
to the castle. </p> 

<p> After he had sold his beans to some random boy in exchange for a cow, he went home and started to make Ze Stew with some leftover
beef he had in the fridge. Halfway though, he realized that he didn’t have the secret ingredient, (Child’s flesh) but he made it anyway
and had it for dinner. It was starting to get dark when he went outside to collect some milk from the cow. </p>

<p> From his little cave, he had a perfect view of the castle. He whipped out his binoculars and had a look to see if there was anything
interesting going on to spice up his so far average day. He saw the king lying in his bed with the prince at his side. It looked like he
was dying and that there was some thing protruding from his head. 
“Is that a broken glass vial?” He said to himself. When he realized that it was the same vial of poison that he had thrown that morning,
he quickly looked away. His eye caught on a room filled with straw. He loved straw, ever since he was a little boy and his mother
abandoned him in a basket full of straw. </p> 

<p> As he looked closer he saw the girl from the market sitting in the middle of the room next to a spinning wheel. It looked like she
was crying, so being the evil gremlin he was he ran off towards the castle to make her suffer even more. </p>

<p> About an hour later (it would take us humans less that 10 minutes to get there, but he had short legs, so don’t judge) he burst
through the door into the room full of straw. Panting, he jumped into the nearest pile and burrowed his way into the centre of the large
pile. He was about to fall asleep, but then remembered what he came here to do. </p> 

<p> When he popped out of the top of the heap, he saw the girl gawking at him. He jumped off of the pile and waddled over to her. He
introduced himself as John because he was in a John-ish mood that day, although his real name was Rumpelstiltskin. She told him that the
prince, now the king since the former king died, was forcing her to turn the straw into gold after her imbecile of a father had told him
that she could.</p> 

<p> Rumpelstiltskin fought the urge to scoff, to him turning straw to gold was simple. He would have just made it, but he asked her what
she had to offer so she would feel insignificant and poor. When she offered him her ring made of gold he said “Why would I want a gold
ring if I am just going to make lots of gold anyway? Oh well, since I feel bad for you I’ll just take it anyway.” </p> 

<p> He took the ring, turned the precious straw into gold that was practically worthless to him, then left. When he got back to his
house he turned the ring into his second favourite stew (after Ze Stew) and put it in a Tupperware container so he could have it
tomorrow. </p> 

<p> The next day he tried to milk his cow, but then realized that it was too old and didn’t produce milk anymore. He was so mad he
killed it and used some of the meat to make more of Ze Stew. It still wasn’t as good without the secret ingredient, but he still felt
much better after eating it. </p> 

<p> He got out his binoculars to check on the girl that he had helped yesterday. He rolled his eyes when he saw her crying in the same
room with even more straw. “Why would you cry if you were in a room full of straw?” He thought to himself, as he sated running down the
hill towards the castle to bully her some more. </p> 

<p> When he got there she cried on and on about the same problems as the day before. He waited for her to finish before he proposed
another deal. This time she offered him her dress. 
“No, keep your clothes on! Don’t you have any more worthless jewelry?” He spat. When she offered him her necklace he sighed, but still
took it and turned the straw into gold. </p> 

<p> When he got home he had some of the golden stew, then went to sleep with the hope that the next day the girl wouldn’t have anymore
problems. Sadly, when he checked on her in the morning, she was still crying in the room that had even more straw than the time before.
He groaned, but then put his binoculars back and trotted off down the hill. </p> 

<p> When he arrived she started to complain to him about her problems, but he interrupted her, not wanting to make the impression that
he cared about her or her complaints. He asked her what she could give him this time, but she had nothing left other than her dress. He
almost did it for free so she would just stop bothering him with her snivels, but he had a flash of inspiration. If he took her first
born child, he could use it’s flesh to make Ze Stew. </p> 

<p> Obviously she agreed, being the helpless person she was, so he turned the straw to gold and left. The next day he checked to make
sure that she wasn’t stuck in the same room, and found the room empty. As he kept looking, he saw her in another room wearing a white
wedding dress. Happy that his work was done, he packed up his belongings and went on a nine month holiday to Miami, Florida. </p> 

<p> Nine months later, he came back to his little cave and thawed out the golden stew that had been in the freezer the whole time and
was still good to eat. He had half of it, saving the rest for later, then walked down to the castle to claim the baby. On the way he
bought a calf, so that the beef in Ze Stew would be tender and young. </p> 

<p> He finally got to the castle and walked in past all the guards all the way up to the queen’s room which he had scouted out from his
cave. He opened the door and saw her sitting on a rocking chair with a brown-haired baby. She looked up and gasped, as if she had
forgotten their deal, which he later found out that she had, which made him think that was unfit as a mother anyway. </p> 

When he trying to take the baby, she cried and cried, just like she had when she was locked it the room full of straw. It was so annoying that he finally relented and said that if she guessed his name within three days then she could keep the baby. Immediately she guessed John, but he said no and explained that he was just in a John-ish sort of mood that day. She guessed again and again but she didn’t get it, although he thought as much.

The next day he went back to the castle and she guessed random names over and over, but none of them were his. When he left he was so incredibly bored and fed up with her, so he stopped at a local bar to get a drink. He ended up totally drunk and he went into the forest and started dancing a round in a circle singing about how happy he was that she would never guess that his name was Rumpelstiltskin.

He woke up in the middle of the woods with no idea where he was, but he saw his footsteps from the day before and followed them. While walking, he saw another set of footprints a few meters away, but he didn’t think much of it. When he finally got home it was the middle of the day, and he was famished. He ate the rest of the golden soup before heading down to the castle.

As the queen guessed names over and over he started to tune out until she said “Could your name be Rumpelstiltskin?” He sat up in shock. How could she have guessed that, being the ignorant girl that she was? Then it dawned on him that the second set of footsteps in the forest could have been those of a guard of someone that had told her.

He was so mad and unwilling to accept that he would not be able to eat Ze Stew with the secret ingredient that he tore himself in half, spilling the golden stew all over the baby that the queen had in her arms. This was absorbed into the baby’s skin and would later turn it’s hair to a rich golden colour. It also cursed her so that one day she would be drawn to Ze Stew that he had intended to put her in.

The end </P>
